Okay I am struggling with understanding how to create a grid in CSS so I looked up some code for me to break apart so I can understand the concepts.

It's like learning how to create a button that initiates a function all over again.

I literally had to break the entire code down step by step so I understood how it worked together.

I am really enjoying this, don't let my comments towards a struggle imply that I don't see that struggle as an oppertunity for growth.
